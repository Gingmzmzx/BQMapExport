BQMapExporter
# BrowserQuest map exporter on Windows

# Origin
Since BQ officially only provides the map export tool for MAC, which is extremely unfriendly to poor people using Windows; and the officially provided Python program is written in Python2, which is outdated; and the official does not give the extra packages that nodejs needs to use. So we sorted out and refurbished the official map export tool, and wrote a one-click execution script.
